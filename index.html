  	<h1> Using Proper Language </h1>
    <header>
    	<p> The shift from in-person to online learning is a big shift for all parties involved, especially during a time of uncertainty as it is with COVID-19. These factors may make it especially difficult for students to stay motivated and do well
      academically, focusing on real-world events and oncoming schoolwork alike. Due to these changes, it is especially important to ensure that steps are taken to keep up the motivation of students. This can be achieved through
      placing a focus on the student's personal improvement rather than a teacher's imposed expectations for a project or grade. </p>
    	<p> To ensure that your students focus more on improvement, use language that gives the students more of a choice rather than forcing them to fulfill certain criteria for a good grade. 
      This gives more of a suggestion so the students feel they have more of a say in the lesson. </p>

    <h3> Instead of saying: </h3>
    <article> "Alright, so I have some choices on how you can do this assignment. I expect you to use at least two of these sources when doing your work. To get full marks, ensure that you cite these sources correctly. <br></article>

  </div>
    <h3> Say this: </h3>
    <article class = "example"> Alright, so you have some choices on how you want to do this assignment. Don't forget to use at least two resources during the assignment. 
    Also, remember to cite your sources as they make your work seem more credible and gives credit to the authors and organizations studying the topic. 
    <br> <br> The use of keywords such as "Remember", and "Don't forget" shifts the focus more to the student's choice rather than using phrases such as "I expect", or "I have". 
    It places the emphasis more on student improvement, rather than student grades.  </article>

  	<h2> Lesson and Break Times </h2>
    <p> Breaks are always important toward optimal learning, but even more so in the midst of a pandemic. Ensure breaks to prevent incorrect posture and attentions from wavering. <br></p>
    <p>Each break should take around 3-5 minutes. Remember to tell your students to stretch, or take a little walk around their house, to relax themselves, and refresh their minds for the next interval of time before the next break. 
    This should constantly keep the children engaged, thus increasing their ability to retain knowledge.</p>

  	<h1> Proper Teaching Mediums </h1>
    	<p> Each person has their own speed of information intake, so we must provide different methods for them to learn as they go. 
      Luckily with online learning, the kids have all the time to learn at their own pace in the day. </p>
    	<h2> How can we do this? </h2>
      <p> Other than teaching the lessons live, we can create videos, make our lessons a bit flashier and eye catching with visuals linking to the material being taught, 
      or even create trivia games once in a while to ignite their competitive drive and push them to understand the information better. <br></p>
      
  </section>
  <section>
  	<h1> Other Methods </h1>
      <p>
        For online games, an example is kahoot. This is a quiz game where you can create quizzes or use existing quizzes. These are typically played with a time limit for each question, driving competition in the class. This engages the whole class while allowing teachers to analyze the areas which students need to improve on. 
      In doing so, timely feedback can be given. </p>
    <img  src="https://educationalresources.online/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Kahoot-1-978x652.jpg" alt="create a Kahoot!" class="small" >
    <p> For making videos, ensure that there are easy and hard questions which correlate to the material being taught, 
    to show how the question can be manipulated despite the solution having to be done using the method taught in class. You don't have to be a professional editor, just simply have your videos as a strong resource for the students.</p>
